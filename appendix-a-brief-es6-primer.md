## An Ultra-brief ES6 Primer

When working with React, you'll see lots of stuff like:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import CoolComponent from './components/cool-component';
import handyLib from './utils/my-handy-lib';
```

These are ES6 module import statements. They allow you to use code from other files. The
paths you see there are relative to the current file.

---

```javascript
export CoolComponent
export default handyLib
```

These are ES6 module export statements. They tell ES6 which things in your file
should be made available to other files via `import`. The `default` keyword means that
you don't need to know the name of the thing when importing (and thus name it whatever
you like!)

---

```javascript
const group = 'ExchangeJS';
let name = 'Christian';
```

These are constants and variables (respectively). They're both kinda like `var`, except
the `const` one denotes that it should not be changed later. In fact it will throw an
error if you try (handy!). A lot of people say it's best to use `const` for most things.

---

```javascript
const { prop1, prop2 } = this.props;
```

This is destructuring. It's pretty sweet. It sort of _pulls_ properties out of an object
and assigns them, so you can use `prop1` and `prop2` like normal constants later.

---

```javascript
const { prop1, prop2, ...rest } = this.props;
```

This is destructuring, but with the added feature of assigning all of the remaining properties
to a new constant called `rest` (can be named whatever you like). This is often referred to as
"the rest pattern"

---

```javascript
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
const sum = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};
```

These are arrow functions. In the first one, the `return` is implied and therefore
optional. The second one acts more like a traditional function definition in that it specifies
its `return` value . In both, the value of `this` is inheritied from the enclosing scope, so
there's no more need for sillyness like `var self = this`, etc
